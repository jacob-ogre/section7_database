    """Find consults with salmonids and replace spp_ev_ls with correct names.

    USAGE:
        python species_list_final_fix.py <salmonf> <infile> <stdfil> <outfil>
    ARGS:
        salmonf, path to a tab'd file of activity_code, species from original
            data
        infile, path to a tab'd version of all TAILS data
        stdfil, path to the ESA standard names file
        outfil, path to the updated, tab'd TAILS data
    COMMENTS:
        For some reason, if a consultation had multiple salmonid species, then
        one or two of the species' names would be repeated while some species'
        names were dropped.  The species counts were correct, but the names 
        were not.  The result was that the number of consultations was 
        underestimated for the less-consulted salmonids and may have been over-
        estimated for the common species (although that's only a 'may'). This 
        script corrects those repeats by referencing the species evaluated in
        the original data from FWS (actually the first tab'd version of that
        data); dropping salmonids from the current data; then appending the 
        correct salmonid names to the other names for each problematic consult.
