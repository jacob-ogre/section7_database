A generic framework (template) for creating Shiny apps.

Shiny apps are very useful for displaying many components of different datasets.
While creating new apps by borrowing code from existing apps is relatively
simple, a common problem (for me) is creating new apps without minor structural
typos that kill an app.  R's lackluster traceback capabilities and often 
mysterious error messages make finding such errors exceedingly difficult. This
framework is intended to attempt to simplify the process of creating new apps 
with minimal effort.

To use the framework, make a copy of the 'Shiny_base' directory and rename the
copy as appropriate for the app. Starting with ui.R, edit the base files to 
create the desired interface and support code needed to generate an app. As with
all Shiny apps, ui.R and server.R are the minimal required files. However, this
framework breaks the inputs among several files of different types to help
improve maintainability and readability of the code base. The default structure
is:

    .
    ├── README
    ├── data
    ├── data_mgmt
    ├── img
    ├── plot
    ├── server.R
    ├── table
    ├── txt
    │   ├── help.R
    │   ├── notes.R
    │   └── text_styles.R
    └── ui.R
