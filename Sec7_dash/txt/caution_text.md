#### Basic data limitations
The TAILS database is not without limitations. While the records were systematically quality filtered and we used the Freedom of Information Act, email, and phone calls to obtain information on over 200 consultations with questionable or obviously missing data, there may be a few minor errors remaining. Last, we suspect there is variation in how different Ecological Services offices enter data into TAILS, but believe that consistency is high enough to allow for comparisons the provide a broad examination of FWS section 7 consultation since 2008.


#### State selections
'State' selections will return approximate counts of consultations and the characteristics of those consultations: FWS does not record the state in which an action will take place, and Ecological Services (ES) offices may span state boundaries, e.g., Rock Island ESFO. If one ES office is known to span many states, then the selected data will default to zero records; please make a selection by ES office and review the records under the Selected Data tab.

#### _Tips_
Most labels are self-explanatory, but bear in mind the following hints:

  + Many boxes and data selectors have small pop-ups that provide additional information. You may also click the 'Getting started' button for a broad usage overview.

  + 'All' or 'All data' indicates the background of all, unfiltered data.

  + 'Select' or 'Selected' indicates the results are based on just the data meeting your selection criteria.
