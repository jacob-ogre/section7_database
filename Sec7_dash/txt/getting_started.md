## _First time here?_

1. Read the information on the Overview page.
2. Read about section 7 consultation on the 'Section 7 information' page (bottom of sidebar).

## _Quick Start_ 

1. Select filter criteria from drop-downs.
2. Click "Apply Selection" button.
3. Peruse the results pages, which include interactive graphs and tables.

## _To start examining the section 7 data_

1. Make selections of different variables describing the characteristics of the data ('Who, What, When, Where') or the consultation outcomes you are interested in ('Select Outcomes').
  + Particular selections may be required for particular views. For example, if you are interested in a particular state, then you need to select a state from the 'State' selector under the 'Who, What, When, Where' drop-down.
  + Selections may be readily combined. If you are interested in both a state and a species, then you may select one of each and then view the results under either the State or Species Summary pages.
2. After making the selections, click the "Apply Selection" button in the sidebar to update the numbers, graphs, and tables in the main window.
3. Choose a 'view' of the data. For example, if you are interested in consultation data for a particular U.S. state, the click on "State Summary" in the sidebar.
  + Note 1: 'Summary' pages will have no values or graphs until an appropriate selection is made.
  + Note 2: Hover the mouse cursor over the bars and lines in the graphs to see the values plotted.

## _Get specific section 7 data_

If you want to download the data for your selection,

1. Click 'Selected Data' in the sidebar to go to the data table page.
2. Click the 'Download data' button near the top-left corner to start the download.
  + The downloaded file is "tab-delimited", that is, the columns in the spreadsheet are separated by the TAB character. This is similar to Comma-separated Variable (.csv) format, except that it works better when columns may have commas within the text. The tabbed file can be opened with Excel or other spreadsheet programs, or read into statistical analysis software such as R.

## _I got a warning in red letters, now the app is unresponsive...help!_

While we have extensively tested the app, there is a chance that you have made a selection that results in a data subset that does not make sense to the underlying code. If that happens, please use the "Refresh" button on your browser to get things going again, and let us know (see below).

## _Find a bug?_

If you believe you have found a bug, please email a description of what you were trying to do and what happened to jmalcom@defenders.org and we will look into it. Thanks for your patience.
